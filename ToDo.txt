- spread scale factor between all stages in a Cascade

- factor a0 out of the biquad coefficients and fix everything

- eliminate the second pole/zero of all conjugate pairs from the
  implementation

- global remembered parameter settings by ParamID

- wrapper template class for simple filter plus channel state

- reuse calculations in filters when only some parameters change

- put private stuff in detail namespace

- SmoothedFilterDesign API to allow changing the transition samples

- SmoothedFilterDesign API to use sample rate to allow specification
  of transition time in milliseconds

- Process all channels at once per sample in SmoothedFilter, never loop
  over channels per sample, so we can specialize for stereo states

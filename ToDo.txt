- spread scale factor between all stages in a Cascade

- eliminate the second pole/zero of all conjugate pairs from the
  implementation

- global remembered parameter settings by ParamID

- SmoothedFilterDesign API to allow changing the transition samples

- SmoothedFilterDesign API to use sample rate to allow specification
  of transition time in milliseconds

- Process all channels at once per sample in SmoothedFilter, never loop
  over channels per sample, so we can specialize for stereo states

- Recurrence relation for bessel polynomial to avoid overflow in fact()

- Fix elliptics

- Clean up Elliptics and give it a Workspace

- Graph the cutoff, passband gain, stopband gain, ripple zone

- Fix biquad shelf slope range causing Nan

- Clean up knob label / parameter names for RBJ Band Pass 1 (constant skirt)
